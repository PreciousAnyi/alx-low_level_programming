# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor
The project involves creating a set of header files and C programs that adhere to specific coding and style guidelines. These guidelines include using macros for defining constants, calculating absolute values, and creating function-like macros for simple arithmetic operations. The project's objectives also include displaying the name of the source file, handling errors, and ensuring compliance with style and coding standards.

Each task corresponds to a specific header file or program file with a unique objective, and the completed project meets the specified requirements and guidelines for each task.

# Task 0: 0-object_like_macro.h

In this task, I created a header file named `0-object_like_macro.h`. This header file defines a macro named SIZE, which serves as an abbreviation for the token 1024.

# Task 1: 1-pi.h

For this task, I created a header file named `1-pi.h`. Within this header file, I defined a macro named PI, which acted as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.

# Task 2: 2-main.c

In this task, I wrote a program named `2-main.c` that printed the name of the file it was compiled from. The program displayed the name of the source file, followed by a new line.

# Task 3: 3-function_like_macro.h

For this task, I created a header file named `3-function_like_macro.h`. Within this header file, I defined a function-like macro named ABS(x). This macro computed the absolute value of a given number x.

# Task 4: 4-sum.h

In this task, I created a header file named `4-sum.h`. Within this header file, I defined a function-like macro named SUM(x, y). This macro computed the sum of two given numbers, x and y.
